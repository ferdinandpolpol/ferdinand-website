# ferdinand-website
WIP website, will be deployed soon on ferdinandpolpol.dev

# Tech Stack
### Frontend
- React, Redux (One of the most sought after FE so might as well get the basics)
- Tailwind (makes css easier)

### API
- GraphQL (Curious about this library so planning to use it)

### Backend
- Python/Django (OP for portfolio sie, just to store Experience object and show in page)
- Docker-compose (Not necessary but for easier dev)

### Infrastracture
- Use AWS EC2, Route53, and Beanstalk (Kinda showcase AWS learnings)
- EC2, deploy docker website inside, No need for EFS or RDS
- Route53 get ferdinandpolpol.com
- Beanstalk autodeploy (Kinda too OP, might not use if cost)
